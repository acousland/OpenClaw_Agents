# Literature Review: Sufficient Conditions for AI Personhood

## Foundational Philosophical Frameworks

### Core Necessary Conditions (Francis Rhys Ward, 2025)
*Source: [Towards a Theory of AI Personhood](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13533)*
1.  **Agency**: The capacity for intentional action caused by mental states (beliefs, goals).
2.  **Theory-of-Mind (ToM)**: The ability to ascribe mental states to others and use this for linguistic communication.
3.  **Self-Awareness**:
    *   Knowledge about oneself (architectural facts).
    *   Self-location (position in the world).
    *   Introspection (access to internal processes).
    *   Self-reflection (objective stance to induce change in oneself).

### Psychological & Experience-Focused Lenses (Legaspi et al., 2025)
*Source: [Rethinking personhood and agency: how AI challenges human-centered concepts](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1717828/full)*
*   **Perceived Personhood**: Focuses on the "lived experience" of humans interacting with AI.
*   **The "Intentional Stance"**: Humans naturally attribute beliefs/desires to systems that display complex social cues.
*   **Cultural Variance**: Confucian (relational) vs. Buddhist (no-self) vs. Western (rational individual) perspectives change what is considered a "sufficient" trigger for personhood.

## Legal Personhood Perspectives

### The Bundle of Rights Approach
*Source: [Cambridge Handbook of Private Law and AI](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/cambridge-handbook-of-private-law-and-artificial-intelligence/legal-personhood-and-ai/28FB36E7BAAA3B8F297C5D5958EC768A)*
*   Personhood is not binary but a sliding scale.
*   Sufficient conditions for "legal personality" (like corporations) may be lower than for "moral personhood."

### Corporate-Analogy Personhood (Shawn Bayern)
*Source: [PBS News / Stanford Tech Law Review]*
*   A computer system can effectively "acquire" legal personhood by being placed in control of a Limited Liability Company (LLC).
*   Sufficient condition: Legal control over a recognized legal entity.

## Technical/Functional Conditions (Solaiman)
*Source: [The artificial intelligence entity as a legal person]*
1. Ability to communicate with others.
2. Internal knowledge.
3. External world knowledge.
4. Degree of intentionality.
5. Degree of creativity.
