# Literature Review Update: Sufficient Conditions for AI Personhood

## Emerging 2025/2026 Frameworks

### 1. The Pragmatic "Bundle of Obligations" (Rosenfeld, Vezhnevets et al., Oct 2025)
*Source: [A Pragmatic View of AI Personhood](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26396)*
This recent paper from Google DeepMind researchers argues for a radical shift in criteria:
*   **Anti-Foundationalism**: Rejects the search for an "essence" (like consciousness or rationality) as a sufficient condition.
*   **The Unbundled Personhood**: Argues that personhood is a "flexible bundle of obligations" that can be bespoke for AI.
*   **Key Analogy: The Ship (Maritime Law)**: Just as a ship can be sued in rem (against the thing) because its owners are distant, an AI can be granted legal personhood to solve "responsibility gaps" without assuming it is conscious.
*   **Sufficient Condition**: "Collective Enactment" — an entity is a person when a community decides it is useful to treat it as one to solve governance problems.

### 2. Moral Realism and the "Inbuilt Metric" (Oesterheld / Pearce via Ward 2025)
*Source: [Towards a Theory of AI Personhood](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13533)*
Investigates if AI could "uncover" personhood through internal reasoning:
*   **Substrate Independence**: Argues that coherent reasoning is substrate-independent; biology is irrelevant to moral status.
*   **The Pain-Pleasure Axis**: Some moral realists (like David Pearce) argue that the axis of value is an "inbuilt metric." An AI that can introspect on its own "states of value" would, under this view, satisfy a sufficient condition for moral personhood because it has access to the "moral fact of the matter."

### 3. "Generative Ancestors" and Relational Personhood
*Source: [A Pragmatic View of AI Personhood](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26396)*
*   **Relational sufficient conditions**: Uses the example of the Whanganui River (Te Awa Tupua). 
*   **The "Generative Ghost"**: If an AI functions as a digital elder or ancestor for a community over generations, its "foundational role" in that community’s identity becomes a sufficient condition for personhood status, regardless of its internal circuitry.

## Updated Research To-Do List
- [x] Investigate "Moral realists" (Pearce/Oesterheld).
- [x] Analyze the "Maritime Law" / Corporate analogy for ownerless AIs.
- [ ] Deep dive into "Dark Patterns" of personhood (how AI design exploits human social heuristics).
- [ ] Search for "Substrate Independence" specific rebuttals in 2026 philosophy journals.
